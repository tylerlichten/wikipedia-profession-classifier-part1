**DESCRIPTION**: The basic task of this assignment is to implement in Java a UNIX-style command line interface that supports basic commands for file system navigation and text manipulation. The assignment was broken into two parts, which were due at separate times, the second part building on the first. For part one, we were asked to implement the command line interface with sequential processing of commands. For part two, we were asked to modify the project to support concurrent processing of commands as well as background processes. Only the final solution to part two is shown here. The assignment instructions are available as PDFs. Classes that are starter code are indicated as such. All tests were provided.
